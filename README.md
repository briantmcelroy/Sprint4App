 This free dashboard explores a dataset of over 50,000 used vehicles advertised between 2018 and 2019. 
 It explores how various factors such as time on market, vehicle age, odometer, and make and model relate to price.
 
 The included jupyter notebook hydrates the data and explores some basic metrics of the dataset.
 It runs on the matplotlib, plotly, and pandas libraries.

 The app features customizable options for rendering the final two graphs, accomplished through matplotlib.pyplot.
 The app runs on the matplotlib, plotly, and pandas libraries, rendered to the web app using the streamlit library.

 To run on your own machine, fork from https://github.com/briantmcelroy/Sprint4App. 
 Ensure you have the above libraries installed in your environment according to requirements.txt.
